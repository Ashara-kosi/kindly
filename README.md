# Kindly

Kindly aims to end cyberbullying and make students feel safer, by leveraging the latest advances in technology and empowering children to solve this pressing challenge. Kindly is a collaboration between young innovator [Gitanjali Rao](https://twitter.com/gitanjaliarao), who conceived the initial proof of concept, and UNICEF, which is currently leading its development as a [digital public good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) and exploring its implementation at scale.

## üí° Motivation

**Did you know that 1 in 3 children is bullied?** According to the [UNESCO Institute of Statistics](http://uis.unesco.org/en/news/new-sdg-4-data-bullying), one third of the globe‚Äôs youth is bullied; this ranges from as low as 7% in Tajikistan to 74% in Samoa.

In the United States, **1 in 5 students get bullied**. About 20% of students ages 12-18 experienced bullying in the United States<sup>[1](https://www.stopbullying.gov/resources/facts)</sup>. 

Bullying includes three core elements: 
* unwanted behavior
* observed or perceived power imbalance
* repetition or high likelihood of repetition of bullying behaviors. 

Bullying affects all youth, including those who are bullied, those who bully others, and those who witness bullying. The effects of bullying may continue into adulthood. Among students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school during the school year in the United States, **15% were bullied online** or by text<sup>[1](https://www.stopbullying.gov/resources/facts)</sup>.
